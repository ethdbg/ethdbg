every contract worker is made up of two parts:

1.) The contract method which usually corresponds to a synchronous/erratic Web3 method that can only be executed by a process not native to the TestRPC instance

2.) The process event listener, which listens for events from the parent process (TestRPC) to execute the function that is needed.

This is done to take the load off the TestRPC and let it function as necessary, while providing a unified interface for function calls from Contract
